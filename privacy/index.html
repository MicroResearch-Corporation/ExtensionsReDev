                <p>The protection of your data is very important to us. Therefore we would like to inform you in the following which data of your visit we use for which purposes. If you have any further questions regarding the processing of your personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us (contact details below). </p>
                <p>If you are interested in the privacy policies of our browser extensions, you can access them via the following links: </p>

                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>Pursuant to our statutory obligations, we would like to inform you about the collection and use of your personal data. </p>
                <p>When you use our website, personal data about you will be collected. This may happen by you entering the data yourself, for example your e-mail address. But our system also collects your data automatically, for example whenever you visit our website. This happens irrespective of the device or the software that you use to visit our website. </p>
                <p>All data that you enter in our app is provided voluntarily; there are no disadvantages to you if you do not provide data. But without certain data, we are unable to provide services or to conclude contracts. Whenever such information is necessary, we will point it out to you. </p>
                <p>On this website, the user’s personal data is only collected within the framework of the existing data-protection law, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal terms used in the text are defined in Art. 4 of the GDPR. </p>
                <p>The GDPR allows data processing in three cases in particular: </p>
                <ul class="bulletList">
                    <li>in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 (a) and 7 GDPR, when you have consented to us processing your data; in this Privacy Policy and in the cases of consent pursuant to Art. 4 no. 11 GDPR, we will inform you in detail and each time for what purposes and under what circumstances your data will be processed by us; </li>
                    <li>in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 (b) GDPR, when processing your personal data is necessary for negotiating, concluding or performing a contract; </li>
                    <li>in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR, if the balancing of interests leads to the conclusion that the processing is necessary to protect our legitimate interests; this means in particular our interests to analyse, optimise and secure the offers on our website – meaning primarily the analysis of user behaviour and storage of access data as well as the use of third-party providers. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Responsible Authority</h2>
                <ul class="personalInfos">

                </ul>
                <h2>Inventory Data</h2>
                <p>We collect inventory data (for example name, address and e-mail address, possibly services used) insofar as they are required for establishing, defining or amending a contract between us and the user. </p>
                <h2>Usage Data</h2>
                <p>We also collect usage data (for example visits to the website, interest in products) to allow the user to use the services on our website and to invoice them. </p>
                <p>We will only combine usage data if and insofar as it is necessary for billing purposes. Otherwise, we will only put together usage data pseudonymously and only insofar as you have not objected. You may send this objection to the address indicated in the “About Us” section or the responsible authority indicated in this Privacy Policy at any time. </p>
                <p>The legal basis for this data processing are our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR in analysing the website and your use, possibly also the statutory permission to store data as part of the negotiation of a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 (b) GDPR. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, our provider stores information, the so-called server log files, each time the website is used; this is information which is automatically transferred by your browser. In detail, this data consists of: </p>
                <ul class="bulletList">
                    <li>your IP address</li>
                    <li>type and version of your browser</li>
                    <li>host name</li>
                    <li>time of visit</li>
                    <li>the page from which you came to our page</li>
                    <li>name of the page opened</li>
                    <li>exact time of usage as well as</li>
                    <li>the amount of data transferred</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data will only be used for statistical purposes and do not allow us to identify you as a user. </p>
                <h2>Consent</h2>
                <p>Whenever we ask you for your consent for the processing of your data, we will inform you in clear language and in an easily accessible way about the cases for which you will be granting your consent. Any consent that we ask you for is voluntary. Any advantage that you wish to gain by granting consent is also available without consent; simply ask us. </p>
                <p>Regarding any consent, you have the right to revoke any consent given to us for the processing of your personal data at any time. You just need to contact us without any particular formal requirement, for example through our contact form, an e-mail to the e-mail address indicated in the “About Us” section or a link to unsubscribe (if offered by us). Your withdrawal has no effect on the legality of the data processing carried out up to that point. </p>
                <h2>Storage Period</h2>
                <p>Your data will generally only remain stored for as long as the purpose of the relevant data processing requires it. Storage beyond that is mainly possible when it is still necessary for us to pursue our rights or for our other legitimate interests or if we are compelled by law to keep your data stored (for example based on tax-law requirements to maintain files, which is generally 6 years, but may last up to 10 years). </p>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>Based on our legitimate interest in a technologically perfect online offering and its design and optimisation in an economically efficient manner pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR, our website uses cookies, allowing our offer to be used better, more effectively and more securely. Cookies are text files, which are saved on your computer and will store certain data about your user behaviour on our website, allowing us for example to make an offer based on your usage up to that point. These can be so-called session cookies, which will be automatically deleted at the end of your visit to our website. But there are also cookies that are stored on your computer permanently, unless you delete them. That way, we are able to recognise your browser the next time you access our website, and we can make you offers that correspond with your use of our website in the past. </p>
                <p>Your browser allows you to prevent the use of cookies in specific cases or in general. Please consult the manual for your browser on this topic. Blocking cookies may limit the operability of our website or other websites visited by you. </p>
                <h2>Users‘ Rights</h2>
                <p>You may request us anytime to provide information about the personal data stored about you free of charge. To avoid misuse, this will require personal identification. </p>
                <h3>Deletion, Correction, Limitation</h3>
                <p>You may at any time demand from us that we correct (or complete) incorrect data as well as a limitation of the processing of data or deletion of your data. This applies in particular if the reason for processing the data is no longer valid, if a required consent has been revoked and there is no other legal basis or if our data processing is unlawful. We will then correct, block or even delete your personal data without delay as far as permitted by law. </p>
                <h3>Objection</h3>
                <p>The right to object to advertisement is governed by our text regarding consent: </p>
                <p>Regarding any consent, you have the right to revoke any consent given to us for the processing of your personal data at any time. You just need to contact us without any particular formal requirement, for example through our contact form, an e-mail to the e-mail address indicated in the “Contact” section. Your withdrawal has no effect on the legality of the data processing carried out up to that point. </p>
                <h3>Data Transfer</h3>

                <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>If and when factual or legal reasons will compel us to amend the Privacy Policy, we will update this page accordingly. This will not change the consent provided by the user. </p>
                <h2>Data Input</h2>
                <h3>Encryption of Data Entry</h3>
                <p>When you enter data on our website, whether in a contact form, during the registration process, when you log in or for payment purposes, the website, where you enter the data, is encrypted. Thus, third parties can not read what you enter. You will recognise the encryption by the lock symbol in your browser and by the URL beginning with “https“ instead of “http“. </p>
                <h3>Contact Form</h3>
                <p>When you fill out a contact form or when you send us an e-mail or another electronic message, your information will be stored for the processing of the request, for possible follow-up questions or for other related questions and will only be used to follow up with the request. </p>
                <p>Your data will be transferred in an encrypted manner, preventing third parties from reading your data while it is being entered. </p>
                <p>Basis for this storage is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 (a) GDPR, which you grant us by filling in the contact form or by your other requests. You may revoke this consent at any time, you just need to contact us without any particular formal requirement (for example in the contact form or by e-mail). This withdrawal has no effect on the legality of the data processing that has occurred up to that point. </p>
                <p>Your data remains stored for as long as the processing of the request requires, in particular as long as the storage is still necessary to perform the contract, to pursue our rights or for our other legitimate interests or we are compelled by law to keep your data stored (for example based on tax-law requirements to maintain files). </p>
                <h2>Payment services</h2>
                <p>The basis for the transfer of your data to our partners is primarily the processing of your contract data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 (b) GDPR and our legitimate interest in a technologically perfect online offering and its design and optimisation in an economically efficient manner pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR. </p>
